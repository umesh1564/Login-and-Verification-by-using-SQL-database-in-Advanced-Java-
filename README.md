# **Login and verification by using SQL database in Advanced-Java**
This repository showcases an implementation of a Login and Verification system using an SQL database and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Advanced Java. The program allows users to register an account with a unique username and password, securely stores their credentials in an SQL database, and lets them log in whenever they want through an easy-to-use GUI interface.
The system incorporates modern Java techniques such as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions and the Swing library for the user interface, making it both user-friendly and robust. The system supports a secure password storage mechanism using hashing and salting to ensure that sensitive data remains protected.<br>
### **Technologies Used:**
- **Java:** Core Java programming language for building the application.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** For database interactions and SQL query execution.
- **SQL Database:** MySQL, SQLite, or any other relational database system for storing user data.<br>
### **Example Flow:**

1. **Registration Window**:
   - Username: `Admin`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
   - Click **Create New Account** -> Account created successfully.

2. **Login Window**:
   - Username: `Admin`
   - Password: `Admin@123`
   - Click **Login** -> Login successful! Welcome, `Admin`.
